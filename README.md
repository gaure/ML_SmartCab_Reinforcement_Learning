ML_SmartCab_Reinforcement_Learning.
Created as part of the Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree
The project uses Python 2.6

In this project I trained a smart agent (smartcab) to reach a destination. By using a Q-learning function my agent learned a policy that allow it to navigate an environment and reach a destination as efficiently as possible. The agent learning process was done through exploration of the environment.

The project contains the agent code, the environment API and some visualization code.
